The just-sound version works in the new projects, scode.
So ... something about how I do state is the problem?

RE design, I think we do not need a way to represent longer
spaces.  What we have to do is respond to them.  A dah
space means start a new letter.  A 3-dah space means start
a new word.  I think that's about all you need.

To code this ... you cannot wait for the next tap and then
measure how long the space was.  You have to have a timer
set at the end of every beep.  If it goes more than a dah,
you start a new letter.  If it goes more than 3 dahs, you
start a new word.  And of course, if it is LESS than a
dah, i.e., a tap starts before the timer times out, you
need to desable the timer.  

It stopped working when I moved the AudioPlayer from 
StatefulWidget to StatelesWidget.
